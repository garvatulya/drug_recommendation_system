1. **Introduction**  
   **1.1 Overview of the System**  
   	Welcome to the Drug Recommendation System\! This system is designed to help you understand potential health issues based on the symptoms you provide and offer valuable recommendations.  
   **1.2 Purpose and Features**  
   	The system uses machine learning algorithms to predict possible diseases and provides information about each disease, including precautions, medications, workouts, and diets.  
     
2. **System Requirements**  
   **2.1 Software Requirements**  
* Python 3.7 or later  
* Required Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, pickle, flask (if using the web version)


3. **Installation**  
   **3.1 Downloading the System**  
   	Download the system package from the provided source (e.g., GitHub repository, ZIP file).  
   **3.2 Extracting Files**  
   	Unzip the downloaded file to your desired location.  
   **3.3 Installing Dependencies**  
   	Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the extracted folder. Install required libraries using pip:  
   pip install \-r requirements.txt  
     
   **3.4 Preparing the Dataset**  
   	Ensure the dataset file is placed in the appropriate directory as specified in the configuration.

4. **Using the System**  
   **4.1 Running the System**  
   	4.1.1 Starting the Application  
   		In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory   and run the application:  
   python main.py  
   	4.1.2 Accessing the User Interface  
   		If using a web interface, open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 (or the address provided by the application).  
   **4.2 Inputting Symptoms**  
   	4.2.1 Entering Symptoms  
   		On the main interface, you will see a text field labeled "Enter Symptoms." Input your symptoms as a comma-separated list. For example: fever, headache, cough.  
   	4.2.2 Submitting Input  
   		Click the "Submit" button to send your symptoms to the system for analysis.  
   **4.3 Viewing Results**  
   	4.3.1 Receiving Predictions  
   		After submission, the system will process your symptoms and predict potential diseases.  
   	4.3.2 Viewing Recommendations  
   		The results page will display the predicted disease(s) along with the following information:  
* Disease Description: A brief overview of the predicted disease.  
* Precautions: Recommended precautions to take.  
* Medications: Suggested medications (consult a healthcare professional before use).  
* Workouts: Recommended exercises or physical activities.  
* Diets: Suggested dietary changes or tips.


**4.4 Model Selection**

	4.4.1 Choosing a Model

		 If the system supports multiple machine learning models, you may have the option to select a model for prediction. Choose from available models such as SVC, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, or Naive Bayes.

	4.4.2 Updating Results

		Click "Update" to apply the selected model and view the new predictions and recommendations.

5. **Troubleshooting**  
   **5.1 Common Issues**  
   	5.1.1 Model not Loading  
   		Ensure that the model file (model.pkl) is present in the specified directory.  
   	5.1.2 Input Errors  
   		Check that symptoms are entered as a comma-separated list without extra spaces or invalid characters.  
   	5.1.3 Web Interface not Responding  
   		Verify that the Flask server is running and that you are using the correct URL.  
     
     
   **5.2 Contact Support**  
   	For further assistance, please contact the support team at \[support@example.com\] or refer to the FAQs section on the projectâ€™s website.  
     
6. **Maintenance**  
   **6.1 Regular Updates**  
   	Ensure that the system is updated regularly to incorporate the latest features and improvements.  
   **6.2 Backup Data**  
   	Regularly backup important data files such as the dataset and model files to prevent data loss.
