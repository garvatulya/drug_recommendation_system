## **Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Drug Recommendation System**

### **1\. Introduction**

#### 

#### **1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of a Drug Recommendation System that utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the most suitable drug for a patient based on input data. The system will process and analyze datasets containing patient information and drug efficacy data to provide recommendations.

#### 

#### **1.2 Scope**

This Drug Recommendation System will focus on:

* Data loading and preprocessing of patient and drug data.  
* Training and evaluating machine learning models to predict drug recommendations.  
* Saving the best-performing model for deployment in a clinical or healthcare setting.

The system will be implemented using Python and relevant data science libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and pickle.

#### 

#### **1.3 Stakeholders**

* **Data Scientists:** Responsible for developing and maintaining the Drug Recommendation System.  
* **Healthcare Providers:** Utilize the system to make informed drug recommendations for patients.  
* **Product Managers:** Oversee the development and deployment of the system to ensure it meets healthcare standards.

### 

### 

### **2\. System Overview**

#### **2.1 System Description**

The Drug Recommendation System is a machine learning-based tool designed to recommend the most effective drug for a patient based on their medical history and other relevant features. It supports multiple algorithms, including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multinomial Naive Bayes. The system preprocesses the data, trains models, evaluates their performance, and saves the best-performing model for deployment.

#### 

#### **2.2 Context of Use**

The system will be used in clinical environments where accurate drug recommendations are essential for patient care. It is intended for use by healthcare providers to assist in decision-making based on patient data.

### **3\. Functional Requirements**

#### **3.1 Data Loading and Preprocessing**

* **Load Dataset:** The system will load datasets containing patient and drug information from CSV files.  
* **Feature Extraction:** The system will split the dataset into features (X) and labels (y), where features may include patient demographics, symptoms, and medical history.  
* **Label Encoding:** The system will encode categorical labels such as drug names using LabelEncoder.  
* **Data Splitting:** The dataset will be split into training and testing sets to allow for model evaluation.

#### **3.2 Model Training**

* **Algorithm Selection:** The system will allow for training models using various algorithms, including SVC, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, and Multinomial Naive Bayes.  
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The system will include mechanisms for tuning model hyperparameters to optimize performance.  
* **Model Training:** Each selected algorithm will be trained on the training dataset to predict the most effective drug for a patient.

#### **3.3 Model Evaluation**

* **Performance Metrics:** The system will evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.  
* **Model Comparison:** Multiple models will be compared based on their performance metrics to select the best model.

#### **3.4 Model Saving**

* **Save Best Model:** The system will save the best-performing model using pickle for future use in clinical settings.  
* **Model Persistence:** The saved model will be persisted in a format that allows for easy loading and use in healthcare applications.

### 

### **4\. Non-Functional Requirements**

#### 

#### **4.1 Performance**

* **Efficiency:** The system should process patient data and train models efficiently, ensuring quick turnaround times for recommendations.  
* **Accuracy:** The system should achieve a high level of accuracy, particularly in recommending the correct drug for a patient’s condition.

#### **4.2 Scalability**

* **Data Scalability:** The system should handle large datasets with numerous patient records and drug options without significant degradation in performance.  
* **Model Scalability:** The system should support adding new algorithms or models as required to improve drug recommendation accuracy.

#### **4.3 Security**

* **Data Protection:** The system must handle patient data securely, with appropriate measures for data encryption, access control, and compliance with healthcare regulations like HIPAA.  
* **Model Integrity:** The integrity of the saved models must be protected to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

#### **4.4 Reliability**

* **Consistency:** The system should produce consistent drug recommendations when run on the same patient data.  
* **Robustness:** The system should handle errors gracefully, with appropriate error messages and recovery mechanisms.

### 

### **5\. System Architecture**

#### **5.1 High-Level Design**

* **Data Pipeline:** The system's architecture will include a data pipeline that handles data loading, preprocessing, and splitting.  
* **Model Training Module:** A dedicated module for training and evaluating models using different machine learning algorithms.  
* **Model Persistence Module:** A module to save and load models using pickle.

#### 

#### 

#### **5.2 Algorithm Descriptions**

* **SVC:** Support Vector Classifier for classification tasks, used to distinguish between different drug options.  
* **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method for classification and regression, used to improve recommendation accuracy.  
* **Gradient Boosting:** A boosting algorithm to enhance model performance by focusing on harder-to-predict cases.  
* **KNN:** A simple, instance-based learning algorithm for predicting the most similar drug based on past patient data.  
* **Multinomial Naive Bayes:** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, used for handling categorical features like drug names.

#### **5.3 Data Flow**

* **Input:** CSV file containing patient and drug data.  
* **Processing:** Data is preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and models are trained and evaluated.  
* **Output:** The best-performing model is saved for future use in recommending drugs for patients.

### **6\. Assumptions and Dependencies**

#### **6.1 Assumptions**

* **Clean Data:** It is assumed that the input dataset is clean, well-structured, and contains accurate patient and drug information.  
* **Python Environment:** The system is developed and run in a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed.

#### **6.2 Dependencies**

* **External Libraries:** The system depends on libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and pickle.  
* **Operating System:** The system is designed to run on standard operating systems like Windows, Linux, or macOS.
